getting the feel for Github

What's up homies!

My name is Andrew Craig and I'm a college sophmore at Johnson County Community College studying Computer Science. I want to learn how to use GitHub in order to have a place where I can work on projects with the JCCC Computer Club or to see other programmer's source code so I can become a better programmer.
